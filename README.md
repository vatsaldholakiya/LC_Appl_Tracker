# LC_Appl_Tracker

This is a Script/Application to track the progress on the number of Leetcode questions and job applications done over time.

Shown below is the Tkinter-based application to mark your application/leetcode questions when done.

Shown below is the graph of applications done per day and the running average as well as the required running average on a daily basis. The idea is that if you do applications more than the required running average each day, you're to reach the deadline faster.

Shown below is the plot of everyday actions and KPIs representing the path to reaching a goal on a daily basis. I've set it in a way that after doing every 10 applications, a mark is made on the plot and on doing each leetcode question a mark is made on the plot to make the numbers fit on the graph in a visually balanced way.
